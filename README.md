# 🔬 Lung cancer detection program
Hello and welcome, in this project, I wanted to analyze the lung cancer dataset and then build a model based on scikit learn Decision tree regressor that provides a screening of lung cancer based on a patient's symptoms

# 🕵️‍♀️ Scenario
Given a dataset that contains various patients symptoms and whether or not these symptoms showed that they had lung cancer, we want to analyze and explore lung cancer, how it is spread accross different categories of people, and also build a model to help better find if a patient has a high chance of suffering from lung cancer

# 🎯 Goals
Our goal is to answer the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Are people with chronic deisease more in risk of having lung cancer?</li>
<li>Is shortness of breath mostly a direct sumptom of lung cancer?</li>
<li>What gender suffers more of lung cancer?</li>
</ul>

Afterwards, <b>Build a machine learning model that learns from the dataset and predicts if a patient has a high chance of having lung cancer</b>

# 📋 Data
The dataset used is the Lung cancer dataset found in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer">this link</a> <br>
This dataset contains many records of symptoms of lung cancer

# 🛠️ Tools used
<ul>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Scikit learn</li>
</ul>

# 🔭 What I learned
While working on this project, I have discovered many new concepts, such as:
<ul>
<li>How to use Joblib to save and use a model in another file</li>
<li>Using the Pandas <code>replace()</code> function with a python dictionary that defines the values to replace</li>
<li>Using <code>fig.suptitle()</code> while working with matplotlib subplots</li>
<li>Defining a <code>random_state</code> when splitting train and test data to keep the same samples for every run</li>
</ul>

# 🛸 Using and navigating the repository
This repository served as a good practice for me as I was able to combine my data analytics and some of my machine learning knowledge together in one useful project, you can download or clone this repository.

<b>If you only want to try thr <a href="Interactive_screening.py">Interactive screening</a> you can directly run it and use it</b>

<b>If you want to run all other files, please make sure that you have pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib, and seaborn installed in your envireonement</b>
